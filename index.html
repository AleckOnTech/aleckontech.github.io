        Release Date will be delayed to October 18, 2025 to make room for the developer's (which is me) time for academics and time for website development. I apologize for the delay because October 8 was a special day for me because it's "Dev day" but I have to give up on releasing to that date. for the reasons mentioned above. 
        <br> <br>Sorry for the delay
